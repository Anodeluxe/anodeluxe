### Hello, Hello! ðŸ‘‹
## Azfanova Sammy Rafif Saputra
## Undergraduate Information Technology Student from Indonesia!

- ðŸ‘€ interested in A.I., Data Science & Machine Learning, and GameDev!
- ðŸŒ± currently learning Godot as my first game engine to develop games with!

## What I'm currently learning:
- Front-End Web Development

Ever since I've joined KMTETI and OmahTI's Data Science training, I now have an interest in learning more and increasing my proficiency on Data Science and also Machine Learning. I'm currently still learning the basics and hoping to build my portfolio in the near future.
  
- Game Development ðŸŽ®

I've been interested in gaming since i was in Elementary School, from watching Let's plays in a small internet cafe. In this era, we have the means to build games and worlds on our own, and maybe I or a team of my own can make those worlds. It's a dram & passion I am going to hopefully realize. Currently I' learning and working on Unreal engine 5 as my first engine!
